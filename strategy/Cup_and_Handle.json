    "pattern_description": {
      "name": "Cup and Handle Pattern",
      "type": "Continuation Pattern",
      "appearance": "The cup and handle pattern is characterized by a 'U' shaped cup followed by a small downward drift forming the handle. The cup is a rounded bottom that signifies a period of consolidation followed by a rise. The handle forms on the right side of the cup through a slight downward or sideways movement in price, indicating a final consolidation before a breakout.",
      "significance": "This pattern suggests a bullish continuation of an existing trend. It indicates that after a period of consolidation (the cup) and a slight pullback (the handle), the price is likely to break out upwards, continuing the prior uptrend."
    },
    "day_trading_strategy": {
      "entry": {
        "signal": "Enter a long position when the price breaks above the upper resistance level of the handle with significant volume, indicating the completion of the pattern and the start of a bullish trend continuation.",
        "confirmation": "Consider waiting for a candle to close above the resistance level of the handle for additional confirmation to reduce the risk of a false breakout."
      },
      "exit": {
        "target": "Set a profit target by measuring the depth of the cup and projecting that distance upward from the breakout point.",
        "stop_loss": "Place a stop loss just below the lowest point of the handle to minimize losses if the breakout fails."
      },
      "risk_management": {
        "position_size": "Calculate your position size based on the distance from the entry point to the stop loss, ensuring the risk does not exceed 1-2% of your trading capital.",
        "profit_booking": "Consider booking partial profits at the target while possibly using a trailing stop loss for the remaining position to maximize gains."
      },
      "considerations": {
        "volume": "An increase in volume on the breakout from the handle confirms the pattern and the likelihood of a successful continuation.",
        "pattern_duration": "The longer the pattern takes to form, particularly the cup, the more significant the breakout tends to be.",
        "market_context": "The cup and handle pattern is more reliable when it aligns with the overall market trend and bullish sentiment."
