            <p><strong>Name:</strong> consolidation</p>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Continuation or Reversal Pattern</p>
            <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Consolidation patterns occur when the price of an asset moves within a confined range, indicating a period where supply and demand are in balance. It is characterized by a series of relatively flat tops and bottoms. Consolidation can take the form of rectangles, triangles (symmetrical, ascending, or descending), or pennants, among others.</p>
            <p><strong>Significance:</strong> This pattern signifies a pause in the prevailing trend where traders and investors are undecided. A breakout or breakdown from the pattern can indicate the direction of the next move.</p>

                <div class="subsection-header">Entry</div>
                <p><strong>Signal:</strong> Enter a trade on a breakout or breakdown from the consolidation pattern. For a bullish breakout, enter when the price moves above the upper boundary of the consolidation range with increased volume. For a bearish breakdown, enter when the price falls below the lower boundary with increased volume.</p>
                <p><strong>Confirmation:</strong> Look for a candle to close outside the consolidation range as confirmation of the breakout or breakdown to avoid false signals.</p>

                <div class="subsection-header">Exit</div>
                <p><strong>Target:</strong> Set a price target based on the height of the consolidation pattern. For breakouts, add the pattern's height to the breakout point. For breakdowns, subtract the pattern's height from the breakdown point.</p>
                <p><strong>Stop Loss:</strong> Place a stop loss just inside the opposite boundary of the consolidation range to minimize losses if the breakout or breakdown fails.</p>

                <div class="subsection-header">Risk Management</div>
                <p><strong>Position Size:</strong> Adjust your position size so that the potential loss from the entry point to the stop loss does not exceed 1-2% of your trading capital.</p>
                <p><strong>Profit Booking:</strong> Consider taking partial profits at the target and using a trailing stop loss for the remainder of the position to capitalize on any further movement while protecting gains.</p>

                <div class="subsection-header">Considerations</div>
                <p><strong>Volume:</strong> A significant increase in volume on the breakout or breakdown can confirm the pattern and increase the chances of a successful trade.</p>
                <p><strong>False Breakouts:</strong> Be aware of false breakouts. Confirmation and a stop loss can help manage this risk.</p>
                <p><strong>Time Frame:</strong> While consolidation patterns can be traded on various time frames, day traders often focus on shorter time frames (like 1-minute, 5-minute, or 15-minute charts) to find and exploit quick movements.</p>
