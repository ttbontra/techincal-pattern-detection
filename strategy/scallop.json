    "pattern_description": {
      "name": "Scallop Pattern",
      "type": "Reversal or Continuation Pattern",
      "appearance": "Scallop patterns can appear in both uptrends and downtrends. An upward scallop resembles a 'J' shape, indicating the potential for a bullish reversal or continuation. A downward scallop has an inverted 'J' shape, suggesting a bearish reversal or continuation. The pattern is characterized by a rounded, semi-circular formation that gradually transitions the price direction.",
      "significance": "The scallop pattern signals a potential shift in market sentiment from bearish to bullish in an upward scallop, or from bullish to bearish in a downward scallop, often following a period of consolidation or a slow trend reversal."
    },
    "day_trading_strategy": {
      "entry": {
        "signal": "For an upward scallop, enter a long position when the price action confirms the rounding bottom and starts ascending along the 'J' curve. For a downward scallop, enter a short position as the price action completes the inverted 'J' curve and begins descending.",
        "confirmation": "Confirmation could include a breakout from a trend line drawn across the initial part of the scallop formation or increased volume as the price moves out of the scallop shape."
      },
      "exit": {
        "target": "Profit targets for scallop patterns can be set by projecting the height of the pattern's opening at the widest part forward from the breakout point.",
        "stop_loss": "Place a stop loss just outside the opposite end of the scallop formation to minimize potential losses. For an upward scallop, this would be just below the rounding bottom. For a downward scallop, just above the rounded top."
      },
      "risk_management": {
        "position_size": "Manage your position size to ensure that the risk from entry to stop loss does not exceed 1-2% of your trading capital.",
        "profit_booking": "Consider booking partial profits at various targets while potentially using a trailing stop loss to capture as much of the trend as possible."
      },
      "considerations": {
        "volume": "An increase in volume as the price moves out of the scallop formation can reinforce the validity of the pattern.",
        "pattern_recognition": "Due to the subjective nature of scallop patterns, utilizing other technical analysis tools for confirmation can help in identifying more reliable trading opportunities.",
        "market_context": "The effectiveness of scallop patterns can be influenced by overall market conditions and sentiment. Analyzing the pattern within the context of current market trends and indicators can provide additional insight."
