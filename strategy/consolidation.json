    "pattern_description": {
      "name": "consolidation",
      "type": "Continuation or Reversal Pattern",
      "appearance": "Consolidation patterns occur when the price of an asset moves within a confined range, indicating a period where supply and demand are in balance. It is characterized by a series of relatively flat tops and bottoms. Consolidation can take the form of rectangles, triangles (symmetrical, ascending, or descending), or pennants, among others.",
      "significance": "This pattern signifies a pause in the prevailing trend where traders and investors are undecided. A breakout or breakdown from the pattern can indicate the direction of the next move."
    },
    "day_trading_strategy": {
      "entry": {
        "signal": "Enter a trade on a breakout or breakdown from the consolidation pattern. For a bullish breakout, enter when the price moves above the upper boundary of the consolidation range with increased volume. For a bearish breakdown, enter when the price falls below the lower boundary with increased volume.",
        "confirmation": "Look for a candle to close outside the consolidation range as confirmation of the breakout or breakdown to avoid false signals."
      },
      "exit": {
        "target": "Set a price target based on the height of the consolidation pattern. For breakouts, add the pattern's height to the breakout point. For breakdowns, subtract the pattern's height from the breakdown point.",
        "stop_loss": "Place a stop loss just inside the opposite boundary of the consolidation range to minimize losses if the breakout or breakdown fails."
      },
      "risk_management": {
        "position_size": "Adjust your position size so that the potential loss from the entry point to the stop loss does not exceed 1-2% of your trading capital.",
        "profit_booking": "Consider taking partial profits at the target and using a trailing stop loss for the remainder of the position to capitalize on any further movement while protecting gains."
      },
      "considerations": {
        "volume": "A significant increase in volume on the breakout or breakdown can confirm the pattern and increase the chances of a successful trade.",
        "false_breakouts": "Be aware of false breakouts. Confirmation and a stop loss can help manage this risk.",
        "time_frame": "While consolidation patterns can be traded on various time frames, day traders often focus on shorter time frames (like 1-minute, 5-minute, or 15-minute charts) to find and exploit quick movements."
