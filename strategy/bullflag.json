    "pattern_description": {
      "name": "Bull Flag Pattern",
      "type": "Continuation Pattern",
      "appearance": "A bull flag pattern appears during an uptrend. It consists of a strong upward move in price (the 'pole') followed by a consolidating downward trend (the 'flag'), which is typically a narrow price channel. The pattern is completed when the price breaks out of the flag formation to continue the previous uptrend.",
      "significance": "This pattern signals that the current trend is likely to continue after a brief pause. The consolidation phase represents a period where bulls are gathering strength for the next leg up."
    },
    "day_trading_strategy": {
      "entry": {
        "signal": "Wait for the price to break above the upper trendline of the flag formation with increased volume. This breakout is your entry signal.",
        "confirmation": "Some traders look for a candle to close above the flag as confirmation to reduce the risk of a false breakout."
      },
      "exit": {
        "target": "Calculate the target by measuring the length of the flagpole and projecting that distance upwards from the point of breakout.",
        "stop_loss": "Set a stop loss just below the lower trendline of the flag or the most recent swing low within the flag to minimize potential losses."
      },
      "risk_management": {
        "position_size": "Determine your position size based on the distance between your entry point and stop loss, ensuring that you're risking no more than 1-2% of your trading capital on a single trade.",
        "profit_booking": "Consider booking partial profits at predetermined levels or using a trailing stop loss to capture as much of the uptrend as possible while protecting gains."
      },
      "considerations": {
        "volume": "An increase in volume on the breakout confirms the pattern and the likelihood of continuation.",
        "false_breakouts": "Be cautious of false breakouts by waiting for confirmation and managing risk with a stop loss.",
        "market_conditions": "Bull flag patterns are more reliable during overall bullish market conditions. Be wary of trading them in bear markets or periods of high volatility."
