            <p><strong>Name:</strong> mini bullflag</p>
            <p><strong>Type:</strong> Continuation Pattern</p>
            <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> A mini bull flag pattern is a scaled-down version of the traditional bull flag pattern, characterized by a short, sharp rally upwards (the 'pole') followed by a small, typically sideways or slightly downward, consolidation phase (the 'flag'). This pattern forms over a shorter time frame, making it ideal for day trading.</p>
            <p><strong>Significance:</strong> The mini bull flag pattern indicates that, even within a brief consolidation, the buying interest remains strong and a continuation of the uptrend is likely once the flag is broken to the upside.</p>

                <div class="subsection-header">Entry</div>
                <p><strong>Signal:</strong> Enter a trade when the price breaks above the upper boundary of the flag formation with noticeable volume. This breakout indicates the continuation of the initial rally.</p>
                <p><strong>Confirmation:</strong> Consider waiting for a candle to close above the flag as a confirmation of the breakout to mitigate the risk of entering during a false breakout.</p>

            <div class="subsection" id="exit">
                <div class="subsection-header">Exit</div>
                <p><strong>Target:</strong> The profit target is determined by measuring the length of the pole and projecting that same distance from the point of breakout at the top of the flag.</p>
                <p><strong>Stop Loss:</strong> Set a stop loss just below the lowest point of the flag formation to protect against a sudden reversal.</p>

            <div class="subsection" id="risk_management">
                <div class="subsection-header">Risk Management</div>
                <p><strong>Position Size:</strong> Calculate the position size by considering the distance between the entry point and the stop loss, ensuring the potential loss does not exceed 1-2% of your trading capital.</p>
                <p><strong>Profit Booking:</strong> To secure profits, consider scaling out of the position by selling portions at different price targets or using a trailing stop loss to benefit from any extended upward movement while safeguarding gains.</p>

                <div class="subsection-header">Considerations</div>
                <p><strong>Volume:</strong> An increase in volume on the breakout lends credibility to the pattern and the potential for continuation.</p>
                <p><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Given the fast-paced nature of day trading, quickly identifying these patterns is crucial. Utilize charting tools and software to aid in recognition.</p>
                <p><strong>Market Context:</strong> Ensure the mini bull flag pattern aligns with the overall market sentiment and that there are no imminent news events or releases that could adversely affect the trade.</p>
