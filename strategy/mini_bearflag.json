    "pattern_description": {
      "name": "Mini Bear Flag Pattern",
      "type": "Continuation Pattern",
      "appearance": "Similar to its bullish counterpart but inverted, the mini bear flag pattern features a brief, sharp decline (the 'pole'), followed by a small, typically sideways or slightly upward, consolidation phase (the 'flag'). This pattern is observed on a shorter time frame, suitable for day trading, reflecting a pause before the continuation of the downtrend.",
      "significance": "The mini bear flag pattern suggests that selling pressure is still present and likely to resume once the flag's lower boundary is breached, continuing the downtrend."
    },
    "day_trading_strategy": {
      "entry": {
        "signal": "Initiate a short position when the price breaks below the lower boundary of the flag formation with significant volume, indicating the continuation of the initial decline.",
        "confirmation": "Look for a candle to close below the flag as confirmation of the breakout to minimize the risk of a false breakout."
      },
      "exit": {
        "target": "Determine the profit target by measuring the length of the pole and projecting that distance downwards from the breakout point at the bottom of the flag.",
        "stop_loss": "Place a stop loss just above the highest point of the flag formation to limit potential losses if the market moves against your position."
      },
      "risk_management": {
        "position_size": "Adjust your position size based on the distance between your entry point and the stop loss, ensuring that you're risking no more than 1-2% of your trading capital on the trade.",
        "profit_booking": "Consider booking profits at different levels or employing a trailing stop loss to capture as much of the downtrend as possible while protecting your gains."
      },
      "considerations": {
        "volume": "A spike in volume during the breakout adds credibility to the pattern and its predictive power for further decline.",
        "quick_execution": "Rapid identification and execution are crucial due to the short-term nature of the pattern. Utilize trading platforms and tools that can help in recognizing these patterns quickly.",
        "overall_market_sentiment": "Check that the mini bear flag pattern aligns with the broader market sentiment. Be cautious of trading against a strong bullish market unless the bearish sentiment is evident in the specific asset being traded."
