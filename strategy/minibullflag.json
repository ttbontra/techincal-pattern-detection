    "pattern_description": {
      "name": "Mini Bull Flag Pattern",
      "type": "Continuation Pattern",
      "appearance": "A mini bull flag pattern is a scaled-down version of the traditional bull flag pattern, characterized by a short, sharp rally upwards (the 'pole') followed by a small, typically sideways or slightly downward, consolidation phase (the 'flag'). This pattern forms over a shorter time frame, making it ideal for day trading.",
      "significance": "The mini bull flag pattern indicates that, even within a brief consolidation, the buying interest remains strong and a continuation of the uptrend is likely once the flag is broken to the upside."
    },
    "day_trading_strategy": {
      "entry": {
        "signal": "Enter a trade when the price breaks above the upper boundary of the flag formation with noticeable volume. This breakout indicates the continuation of the initial rally.",
        "confirmation": "Consider waiting for a candle to close above the flag as a confirmation of the breakout to mitigate the risk of entering during a false breakout."
      },
      "exit": {
        "target": "The profit target is determined by measuring the length of the pole and projecting that same distance from the point of breakout at the top of the flag.",
        "stop_loss": "Set a stop loss just below the lowest point of the flag formation to protect against a sudden reversal."
      },
      "risk_management": {
        "position_size": "Calculate the position size by considering the distance between the entry point and the stop loss, ensuring the potential loss does not exceed 1-2% of your trading capital.",
        "profit_booking": "To secure profits, consider scaling out of the position by selling portions at different price targets or using a trailing stop loss to benefit from any extended upward movement while safeguarding gains."
      },
      "considerations": {
        "volume": "An increase in volume on the breakout lends credibility to the pattern and the potential for continuation.",
        "pattern_recognition": "Given the fast-paced nature of day trading, quickly identifying these patterns is crucial. Utilize charting tools and software to aid in recognition.",
        "market_context": "Ensure the mini bull flag pattern aligns with the overall market sentiment and that there are no imminent news events or releases that could adversely affect the trade."
